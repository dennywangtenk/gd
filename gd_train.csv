Working in a big company like Apple was always a dream since my business school days. That dream turned sour when I joined their Cupertino office back in 2013. I was in my 6th month of pregnancy and was adviced to undergo NIPT by my doctor. Apple’s health care provider, United Healthcare, refused to accept my claim for it by stating I was not eligible for it as I was under the age of 35! This was totally unbelievable!...

With excellent compensation, lots of responsibility, and challenging work comes long hours. APT is not a 9-5 environment. At times, it can be difficult to maintain a good work/life balance. APT's fundamental mission (applying the principles of experimentation to solve complex business challenges) is very compelling and differentiated, but the end applications of it can be less interesting at times.",5.0,"
APT is full of brilliant, hard-working, and helpful people that care about your professional development and the company's success. Even as it has grown rapidly and was acquired by Mastercard last year, it has retained an energetic, young culture that feels not far from its start-up roots. While it may sound cliche, a good idea is treated as such regardless of the level of seniority that it comes from. APT quickly...

Sometimes the work-life balance can be challenging. Everyone has good weeks and bad weeks, as the client work can be pretty cyclical in nature. There's certainly no average work week, but hours can range from as low as 40 to as high as 60-65 during the busiest times. While the balance is challenging, fortunately the work itself is engaging enough to not make the work-life balance too painful.",5.0,"
